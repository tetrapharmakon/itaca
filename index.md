## What is ItaCa?

During the last [Category Theory](http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/ct2019/) in Edinburgh, Scotland, it became apparent how many Italians are present in the Category Theory community: some of us proposed to join them all in a semi-official network. This is **ItaCa**: a group of (not necessarily) young mathematicians scattered all around the world, doing Category Theory.

Our name stands for **Ita**lian **Ca**tegory theorists, but it also reminds the isle where Odysseus strived so hard to come back.

The community we would like to create is as open and inclusive as possible, without distinction of gender, ethnicity, language, or mathematical opinion. The isle of ItaCa is open to all kinds of mathematicians, no matter their nationality and background.

It is, however, made by Italians, and more generally by category theorists in Italy, and has (will always have?) a core of Italians among the organizers and promoters.

This is to say: despite its apparent absence from the scenes, Italian Category Theory exists, and strives to come home.

We are still a small community, but we are slowly growing. Join us [on various channels](dummy)!
